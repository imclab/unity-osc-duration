unity-osc-duration
==================

A sample project using [Duration](https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/Duration) with Unity.

Duration is a timeline controlling tool written by YCAMInterLab. This program receives several
types of messages sent from Duration over OSC (Open Sound Control).

This project uses unity-osc written by me. For details, see https://github.com/keijiro/unity-osc
